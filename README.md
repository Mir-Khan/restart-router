# restart-router script
A simple script to restart my Linksys AX 1800 router which seems to need a restart **every single night**. 

Uses Python and the Selenium library, so make sure to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/selenium_installation/) if you want to make use of this script.
